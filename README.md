# Tration-Backend
Backend for Tration Application

This is now a API repo for Tration application

# Dev Set Up
`git pull https://github.com/Quick-Silver-Stash/Tration-Backend.git`  
`cd Tration-Backend/functions`  
`npm install`  

# Dev
go add your function to the directory `functions/index.js`

I will investigate if we can separate out the API for auto deployment - and organize it in the way that makes sense.

# Deploy
`firebase deploy`

will automatically deploy the function to firebase cloud. You can check the function deployed at:
